        Thank you so much for your support of King Estate. Please remember that we have beautiful guest facilities at the winery, and we would love to host you sometime soon.

        “ My wife and I have been enjoying the wonderful food and service at The French Gourmet for many years now. We brought some friends over Monday evening who had never been to The French Gourmet, and we all had a great meal. You probably don’t remember us, but you introduced us to a French red.
        wine served in the Eisch glasses that went perfectly with the rib eye steak you were serving for Restaurant Week.
        Our friends were duly impressed and will no doubt be returning soon, perhaps with us for a weekend breakfast. (I think The French Gourmet is the ONLY restaurant that understands how to do Eggs Benedict exactly right!)
        We all loved the steak.
        Best regards, ”
